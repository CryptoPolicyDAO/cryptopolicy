description: Scope and purpose of the Blockchain Regulation Matrix
---

The blockchain regulation matrix is meant to make you think about how the different layers of the blockchain would affect
you as a consumer and as a citizen. Regardless of the country you are a citizen in, this matrix can be applied as a framework to regulating the
blockchain.

## Scope and Purpose

The scope of each layer is as comprehensive and exhaustive as possible. There should be no stone unturned or transaction unknown, so to speak.
The purpose is to get to the bottom of each of the concerns below as thoroughly as possible and to either highlight existing tech that fulfills all of them or the tech needed to
fulfil them.

a) Government Concerns

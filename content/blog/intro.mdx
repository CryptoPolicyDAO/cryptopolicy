The need for insurance and risk management in Web3

</Callout>

<p className="indent">
  The backstory of Crypto Policy DAO starts with its 
  {" "} <a href="/members" className="underline underline-offset-4">
     founder{" "}
    </a> and the need for
  clarity while creating a crypto insurance startup. As with most businesses,
  there are financial and legal obligations that need to be met, and within the
  traditional insurance market, those were yet to be defined for Web3 insurance.
  Even though there are no laws specified for cryptocurrency insurance just yet,
  there is still an insurance framework that can be applied. Usually they are
  specific to states and countries, and now even an entire union of countries
  with the European Union.
</p>
<br />
<p className="indent">
  However, if we were to apply the current insurance regulatory frameworks to
  crypto insurance, by default, it would not be possible to start a crypto
  insurance company. This is because the framework for current traditional
  insurance companies apply a set of standards that doesnt correlate to the web3
  space. Th main two frameworks for traditional insurance is the EIOPA from
  Europe and the NAIC from the United States. The essence of both of the
  frameworks is to provide parameters, or boundaries, on what financially
  constitutes an insurance company and clearly differentiates it from other
  companies, like a financial or investment company.

  When creating an insurance company, the two main aspects to consider initially
  is the legal enforcement of insurance policies and the financial requirements
  established by the government. Essentially, the customers insurance policy is
  half of your focus while the other half is meeting financial requirements,
  except in this situation, there is no legal precedence established and the
  financial framework that exists only applies to the traditional insurance
  market.
</p>
## Why is there a financial framework at all?
<br />
<p className="indent">
  Companies may have cash on hand that they want to invest and try to earn some
  of their losses back. There is nothing wrong with this process as at all, as
  any company should have a right to invest on the businesses behalf. Though
  within the insurance industry, there are several different types of insurance
  mechanisms, or engines, powering these companies and that is where the
  financial framework requirement starts.
</p>
<br />
<p className="indent">
Not to go too into depth, though a financial framework is not needed in order to define what 
an insurance company is, unless the profits of the company go back to the policyholders, 
or the customers. Regardless of the reasons why this is, one of its by-products is the 
amount of financial investment being done on

<Callout>The need for insurance and risk management in Web3</Callout>

The backstory of Crypto Policy DAO starts with it's [founder](/members)
and the need for legal and financial clarity while creating a crypto insurance startup.
As with most businesses, there are financial and legal obligations that need to be
met, and within the traditional insurance market, those were yet to be defined
for Web3 insurance. Even though there were no laws specified for cryptocurrency
insurance at this time, there is still a financial framework from traditional
insurance that can be applied for some guidance. Usually they are specific to states
and countries, and now even an entire union of countries with the European Union<sup>1</sup>.

However, if we were to apply the current insurance regulatory frameworks to
crypto insurance, by default, it would not be possible to start a crypto
insurance company. This is because the framework for current traditional
insurance companies apply a set of standards that doesnt correlate to the web3
space. Th main two frameworks for traditional insurance is EIOPA from
Europe and NAIC from the United States. The essence of both of the
frameworks is to provide parameters, or boundaries, on what financially
constitutes an insurance company and clearly differentiates it from other
companies, like a financial or investment company.

<Callout>Legal and Financial requirements</Callout>

When creating an insurance company, the two main aspects to consider initially
is the legal enforcement of insurance policies and the financial requirements
established by the government. Essentially, the customers insurance policy is
half of your focus while the other half is meeting financial requirements,
except in this situation, there is no legal precedence established and the
financial framework that exists only applies to the traditional insurance
market.

## Why is there a financial framework at all?

Companies may have cash on hand that they want to invest and try to earn some
of their losses back. There is nothing wrong with this process as at all, as
any company should have a right to invest on the businesses behalf. Though
within the insurance industry, there are several different types of insurance
mechanisms, or engines, powering these companies and that is where the
financial framework requirement starts.

Without going into depth, a financial framework is not needed in order to
define what an insurance company is, unless the profits of the company go back
to the policyholders, or the customers. However, regardless of the reasons why this is,
one of the by-products of the financial framework is the creators of it were not aware of
Decentralized Finance (DeFi) when it was created, so it inhibits innovation within the crypto
insurance space. Below are the main points of the financial framework provided by the National
Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) in their Insurance Regulatory Information System
(IRIS) Ratio manual from 2021 for United States.

Above is the most recent version of the NAIC ratios in the financial framework that illustrate the acceptable
parameters for an insurance company. These ratios are flexible and are flexible, but if you
earned 12% investment yield three years in a row as an insurance company, they were more likely to
think that you were a bank or investment company instead of an insurance company. Albeit, that itself is a flaw,
they are the current thresholds for definining an insurance company from a financial perspective.

According to the whitepaper for Bitcoin, one of it's main purposes for existing was to decrease
the reliance on banks for people around the globe. Since the blockchain removes the role of the
intermediary when exchanging funds between two parties, it is now possible to deprive a bank completely
of the fees they generate just from us going about our normal day spending money with our debit / credit card as we do.
Now, since the transaction fees arent going to the banks, they can go back to the users. Not all DeFi scenarios
are the same, but for the most part the transaction fees that are generated are given back to the individuals
that provided the liquidity for the transactions to be possible, much like the Treasury of the United States.
Except, in the case of the United States, the US Treasury provides the funds while a US sovereign entity, the
Federal Reserve, receives all of the transaction fees generated by the users. Which is also known as roughly 1/4
of the debt that the United States has. Thats right, not to digress, but roughly one quarter of the United States debt
is to the Federal Reserve, which is not part of the United States because it has "legislative sovereignty" from the US.

So, because the everyday-transaction fees are now going back to the everyday-users\*, this means that it is not
just possible for the investment yield to be above 5.5%, but it is expected to be much more, and sometimes daily.
When everyday users are able to generate much more than 5.5% investment yield, then the parameters need to be
updated in order to maintain a continuously sensible and pragmatic level of compliance.

Now that we are more familiar with DeFi and the very real-world interest that can be earned from it, it's time to reevaluate
the finanical parameters of what constitutes a crypto insurance company, when to reevaluate them in the future, to what
thresholds can be considered, and what needs to be done in order to apply those new standards. That all may sound
convoluted, but it's the start of risk management and it needs to be practiced in every aspect of our political spectrum.

Historically, laws were written in a reactionary manner in order to prevent a clever crime from being repeated again.
Whether it was white collar or blue collar, if a law cant be clearly and succintly written to prevent it, then the
courts would create a precedence for it and honor it that way. But what happens in crypto when the judges have never
heard of metamask or opensea or the lawyers dont know the difference between a flash loan and an exploit?

## Applying new knowledge to an old process

Education is the best precursor to writing effective legislation. We are at a time when information is so fast and readily
available that we should be able to create more relevant and impactful legislation in a sensible timeline. The blockchain
provides immeasurable value that our govnerments are yet to even consider taking advantage of. And by all means, as valuable
as a Bitcoin or Ethereum ETH is, it is not even 1/1000th of the value that the blockchain provides.

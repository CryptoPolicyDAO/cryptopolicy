The need for insurance and risk management in Web3

</Callout>

The backstory of Crypto Policy DAO starts with its founder and his need for clarity while creating a crypto insurance startup.
As with most businesses, there are financial and legal obligations
that need to be met, and within the traditional insurance market, those were yet to be defined for Web3. Even though there
are no laws specified for cryptocurrency just yet, there is still an insurance framework that can be applied, and those are specific to
states and countries, and now even an entire union of countries with the European Union.

However, if we were to apply the current insurance regulatory frameworks to crypto insurance, by default it would not be possible
to start a crypto insurance company.

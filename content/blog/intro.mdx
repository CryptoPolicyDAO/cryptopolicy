<Callout>The need for insurance and risk management in Web3</Callout>

The backstory of Crypto Policy DAO starts with its founder
and the need for clarity while creating a crypto insurance startup. As with
most businesses, there are financial and legal obligations that need to be
met, and within the traditional insurance market, those were yet to be defined
for Web3 insurance. Even though there are no laws specified for cryptocurrency
insurance just yet, there is still an insurance framework that can be applied.
Usually they are specific to states and countries, and now even an entire
union of countries with the European Union.

However, if we were to apply the current insurance regulatory frameworks to
crypto insurance, by default, it would not be possible to start a crypto
insurance company. This is because the framework for current traditional
insurance companies apply a set of standards that doesnt correlate to the web3
space. Th main two frameworks for traditional insurance is the EIOPA from
Europe and the NAIC from the United States. The essence of both of the
frameworks is to provide parameters, or boundaries, on what financially
constitutes an insurance company and clearly differentiates it from other
companies, like a financial or investment company.

When creating an insurance company, the two main aspects to consider initially
is the legal enforcement of insurance policies and the financial requirements
established by the government. Essentially, the customers insurance policy is
half of your focus while the other half is meeting financial requirements,
except in this situation, there is no legal precedence established and the
financial framework that exists only applies to the traditional insurance
market.

## Why is there a financial framework at all?

Companies may have cash on hand that they want to invest and try to earn some
of their losses back. There is nothing wrong with this process as at all, as
any company should have a right to invest on the businesses behalf. Though
within the insurance industry, there are several different types of insurance
mechanisms, or engines, powering these companies and that is where the
financial framework requirement starts.

Without going into depth, a financial framework is not needed in order to
define what an insurance company is, unless the profits of the company go back
to the policyholders, or the customers. Regardless of the reasons why this is,
one of its by-products is the amount of financial investment an insurance
company has, and its not the amount of investment, its the percentage
allocation of their portfolio.

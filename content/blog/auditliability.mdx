<Callout>What is Audit Liability and why is it important?</Callout>

##### Understanding the nuances between developer intent and code execution is critical in establishing clear Audit Liability standards in web3.

The expectation of a smart contract audit often exceeds reality, as developers may not fully grasp the
concept of defining a user journey or the extent of potential vulnerabilities, which is crucial in establishing clear
boundaries for Auditor Liability. Though, when dealing with
programming languages, fully comprehending all potential actions of a smart contract can be challenging. Developers aim
to ensure their contracts operate as intended and are free from vulnerabilities that could result in loss of funds or
unintended outcomes. However, smart contracts operate based on the defined logic principles and syntax of the programming language
used, meaning certain operations are strictly bound by these rules.

Auditors must go beyond merely identifying potential errors, they need to grasp the developer's intended user journey
and expectations of the app to ensure the smart contracts behave as expected. For example, in the programming language Solidity,
a common issue is integer overflow and underflow, and an integer overflow might be a deliberate
feature in some scenarios, like resetting a counter, rather than a vulnerability. Misinterpreting these intentions can
lead to misguided corrections and unintended actions. Therefore, a thorough understanding and clear communication between developers and auditors
are essential for accurate and effective audits and especially for establishing Auditor Liability.

Auditor Liability begins with the auditing scope and ends with the implementation of the corrections, so establishing
the parameters that define it is necessary in order to understand if an audit is thorough, comprehensive, and utilizing up to-date smart contract
best practices. Establishing a standard framework for Auditor Liability requires clear communication of what occurs during an audit,
including educating developers on the importance of defining user journeys and security expectations they may not have considered.

##### What is Integer Overflow?

Integer overflow occurs when a calculation exceeds the maximum value that can be stored in a variable.
In Solidity, for example, the `uint8` data type can store values from 0 to 255, so if you add 1 to 255,
it overflows and wraps around to 0, which could be intentional or in could be unintentional and lead to a possible exploit.

```solidity
uint8 max = 255;
uint8 result = max + 1;
```

However, in actuality, this is what is happening:

```solidity
result = 255 + 1 = 0
```

##### What is Integer underflow?

Integer underflow occurs when a calculation goes below the minimum value that can be stored in a variable.
Using the same uint8 data type in Solidity, if you subtract 1 from 0, it underflows and wraps around to 255.

```solidity
uint8 min = 0;
uint8 result = min - 1;
```

As well, In this scenario, since uint8 cannot store negative numbers,
subtracting 1 from 0 causes it to wrap around to the highest value, which is 255.

```solidity
result = 0 - 1 = 255
```

One of the benefits of programming languages in smart contracts is that you can reuse other code that is audited and
continually tested in real-time, and an example of this is OpenZeppelin which created the SafeMath library. The
SafeMath library is available for anyone to use in their contract which makes that particular section of the code
more readable and more understood regarding the developers intended actions.

##### Example with the SafeMath OpenZeppelin import

```silidity
using SafeMath for uint8;

uint8 max = 255;
uint8 result = max.add(1); // This will revert the transaction

uint8 min = 0;
uint8 result = min.sub(1); // This will revert the transaction
```

Even though OpenZeppelin's SafeMath exist for Solidity, it is not present in all pogramming languages for various reasons, though some
are because its not needed. For example, in Vyper, Tezos, and Move integer overflow and underflow are inherently prevented as the language includes built-in checks that revert
transactions on such operations. This design choice simplifies development and enhances security, but it still necessitates
a comprehensive audit to ensure there are no other logical errors or overlooked vulnerabilities.

#### Comparison of programming languages

| Language          | Integer Overflow/Underflow Vulnerability | Mitigation Method                          |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Solidity          | Yes (pre-0.8.0) / No (0.8.0+)            | Library (SafeMath) / Syntax (0.8.0+)       |
| Vyper             | No                                       | Syntax                                     |
| Rust              | Yes                                      | Syntax (Debug mode)/Library (Release mode) |
| C++               | Yes                                      | Manual / Library / Compiler options        |
| Tezos (Michelson) | No                                       | Syntax                                     |
| Move (Libra)      | No                                       | Syntax                                     |
| Cairo             | No                                       | Syntax                                     |
| Bitcoin Script    | No                                       | Syntax                                     |

#### So how do we define Auditor Liability?

While tools like OpenZeppelin's SafeMath exist, Auditor Liability includes assessing whether developers have appropriately implemented such best practices,
and educating them on the historical context and importance of these standards.

Auditor Liability encompasses not only identifying vulnerabilities but also bridging the gap between
a developer's often incomplete vision and the actual code implementation, necessitating a deep
understanding of both intended functionality and potential exploit history. This is crucial in smart contract auditing
as both parties should rely on the audit with almost equal weight.

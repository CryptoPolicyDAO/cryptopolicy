<Callout>What is Auditor Liability and why is it important?</Callout>

##### Understanding the nuances between developer intent and code execution is critical in establishing clear Audit Liability standards in web3.

The expectation of a smart contract audit often exceeds reality, as developers may not fully grasp the
concept of defining a user journey or the extent of potential vulnerabilities, which is crucial in establishing clear
boundaries for Auditor Liability. Though, when dealing with programming languages, fully comprehending all potential actions of
a smart contract can be challenging. Developers aim to ensure their contracts operate as intended and are free from vulnerabilities
that could result in loss of funds or unintended outcomes. However, smart contracts operate based on the defined logic principles and
syntax of the programming language used, meaning certain operations are strictly bound by these rules. The importance of clearly defining
Auditor Liability cannot be overstated, as it directly impacts the trust and security of smart contracts in the web3 ecosystem.

Auditors must go beyond merely identifying potential errors, they need to grasp the developer's intended user-journey
and expectations of the dApp (decentralized app - because its an app deployed on decentralized blockchain tech as opposed to centralized
tech like Google Cloud or AWS) to ensure the smart contracts behave as expected. For example, in the programming language Solidity,
a common issue is integer overflow and underflow, and an integer overflow might be a deliberate
feature in some scenarios, like resetting a counter, rather than a vulnerability. Misinterpreting these intentions can
lead to misguided corrections and unintended actions. A deep understanding of the developer's goals and the application’s context
is essential for auditors to accurately assess and report on the contract's safety and functionality.

Auditor Liability begins with the auditing scope and ends with the implementation of the corrections, so establishing
the parameters that define it is necessary in order to understand if an audit is thorough, comprehensive, and utilizing up to-date smart contract
best practices. Establishing a standard framework for Auditor Liability requires clear communication of what occurs during an audit,
including educating developers on the importance of defining user journeys and security expectations they may not have considered.

##### What is Integer Overflow?

Integer overflow occurs when a calculation exceeds the maximum value that can be stored in a variable.
In Solidity, for example, the `uint8` data type can store values from 0 to 255, so if you add 1 to 255,
it overflows and wraps around to 0, which could be intentional or it could be unintentional and lead to a possible exploit.

```solidity
uint8 max = 255;
uint8 result = max + 1;
```

However, in actuality, this is what is occurring:

```solidity
result = 255 + 1 = 0
```

##### What is Integer underflow?

Integer underflow occurs when a calculation goes below the minimum value that can be stored in a variable.
Using the same uint8 data type in Solidity, if you subtract 1 from 0, it underflows and wraps around to 255.

```solidity
uint8 min = 0;
uint8 result = min - 1;
```

As well, in this scenario, since uint8 cannot store negative numbers,
subtracting 1 from 0 causes it to wrap around to the highest value, which is 255.

```solidity
result = 0 - 1 = 255
```

One of the benefits of programming languages in smart contracts is that you can reuse other code that is audited and
continually tested in real-time, and an example of this is OpenZeppelin which created the SafeMath library. The
SafeMath library is available for anyone to use in their contract which makes that particular section of the code
more readable and more understood regarding the developers intended actions.

##### Example with the SafeMath OpenZeppelin import

```silidity
using SafeMath for uint8;

uint8 max = 255;
uint8 result = max.add(1); // This will revert the transaction

uint8 min = 0;
uint8 result = min.sub(1); // This will revert the transaction
```

Even though OpenZeppelin's SafeMath exist for Solidity, it is not present in all pogramming languages for various reasons, though some
are because it is not needed. For example, in Vyper, Tezos, and Move integer overflow and underflow are inherently prevented as the language includes built-in checks that revert
transactions on such operations. This design choice simplifies development and enhances security, but it still necessitates
a comprehensive audit to ensure there are no other logical errors or overlooked vulnerabilities.

#### Comparison of programming languages

| Language          | Integer Overflow/Underflow Vulnerability | Mitigation Method                          |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Solidity          | Yes (pre-0.8.0) / No (0.8.0+)            | Library (SafeMath) / Syntax (0.8.0+)       |
| Vyper             | No                                       | Syntax                                     |

| C++               | Yes                                      | Manual / Library / Compiler options        |
| Tezos (Michelson) | No                                       | Syntax                                     |
| Move (Libra)      | No                                       | Syntax                                     |
| Cairo             | No                                       | Syntax                                     |
| Bitcoin Script    | No                                       | Syntax                                     |

#### So how do we define Auditor Liability?

While tools like OpenZeppelin's SafeMath exist, Auditor Liability includes assessing whether developers have appropriately implemented such best practices,
and educating them on the historical context and importance of these standards.

Auditor Liability encompasses not only identifying vulnerabilities but also bridging the gap between
a developer's often incomplete vision and the actual code implementation, necessitating a deep
understanding of both intended functionality and potential exploit history. This is crucial in smart contract auditing
as both parties should rely on the audit with almost equal weight. Furthermore, continuous education and updates on evolving best practices and emerging
vulnerabilities are vital for both developers and auditors to maintain a high standard of security in smart contract deployments.

Auditor Liability is not just about identifying flaws; it’s about understanding and documenting the logic behind every decision made in the code.
As such, we are suggesting the use of a Logic Tree as a roadmap, laying out each step in the contract’s execution and highlighting areas where risks might emerge.
By incorporating this approach, both developers and auditors can ensure a more transparent and secure deployment process.

#### Logic Tree

To illustrate how a logical tree could define the intended outcome of smart contracts, we will use the
standard ERC20 token as an example below:

This example further illustrates how a developer could benefit from using a logic tree when writing their smart contracts
and especially when they provide an auditor with their code. Here is a fictitious example:

```

A logic tree like the one above is a way to define and outline the steps and actions a developer takes to illustrate how they
expect their code to operate as intended. This means defining the logical barriers that are needed to prevent
errors and unintended consequences and the logical tree above provides a solution to that.

Auditor Liability should include a review of whether the developers have followed best practices,
such as using well-audited libraries like OpenZeppelin, and whether the code aligns with the intended
user-journey and security protocols.

#### How do we hold the auditor accountable and define liability?

At this point, a logic tree only holds the developer accountable, though the intention is for a logic tree to establish
accountability for both the developer and the auditor. And this is especially important because with all profession's
whose business is their professional opinion, liability must be clearly defined so that it can be clearly enforced.

In other professions there are boards, committees, and governing bodies to establish and define professional
liability and the same must be done with web3 auditors. The logic tree above is a basis to defining and implementing
auditor liability and should be used accordingly. By creating a web3 agency the government can address the growing need
to hold auditors accountable for their professional opinions and to establish more trust in web3 that is greatly needed.

  <strong>Lobbying for Web3-friendly Regulation</strong>
</Callout>

Crypto Policy DAO is a platform to provide clear and concise insight into establishing web3-friendly regulation.
We achieve this by collaborating together from all sides of the blockchain in oder to understand the needs of friendly web3 regulation.

Legislation should not be meant to inhibit or control. When done properly it should protect the consumer, while being able to identify and prosecute the criminals clearly.
We believe that in order to achieve this there must be a base, or backbone, to the thought-process of approaching web3-friendly regulation.
For us that is the Blockchain Regulation Matrix, which approaches this through the eyes of the consumer from the beginning of a standard blockchain transaction to the end.

By approaching the blockchain regulation matrix through the steps of a typical transaction, we can identify layers which gives us more clarity into
identifying the needs of appropriate web3 regulation.

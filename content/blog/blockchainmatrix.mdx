  <strong>Lobbying for Web3-friendly Regulation</strong>
</Callout>

The Blockchain Regulation Matrix (BRM) establishes a framework outlining the concerns of regulating the
blockchain from both the government and the consumer perspective, and in doing so, provides a pragmatic
and clear approach to Web3 regulation. The BRM outlines regulation aspects of the blockchain by viewing
it as a blockchain stack in many layers starting with the electricity physically supporting the blockchain
at the base layer, all the way to the process of offloading crypto to fiat currency. With centralization
and decentralization on either side of the matrix, the primary objective of the BRM is to understand
where and how regulation of the blockchain should be developed specific to each layer.

The first row of the BRM is the electricity that is provided to the blockchain enabaling its performance.

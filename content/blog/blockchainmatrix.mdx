  <strong>Lobbying for Web3-friendly Regulation</strong>
</Callout>

The Blockchain Regulation Matrix (BRM) establishes a framework of the concerns of regulating the
blockchain from both the government and the consumer perspective, and in doing so, provides a pragmatic
and clear approach to Web3 regulation. The BRM outlines the blockchain stack in layers starting with
the electricity that is physically supporting the blockchain at the base layer, all the way to the
process of offloading crypto to fiat currency. The primary objective of the BRM is to understand
where and how regulation of the blockchain should be developed specific to each layer, so
on the left side of the matrix are centralized projects and on the right side are decentralized ones

The first row of the BRM is the electricity that powers the entire blockchain, and thats includes both
centralized and decentralized projects doing so. For example, if the electricity is produced by a private company
or a municipality, then that would be a centralized project. For a decentralized electricity producing project, lets
consider a group of individuals that build a solar farm together and use the electricity to power their bitcoin mining rigs.
By viewing each layer in terms of centralization and decentralization, we can apply a framework that allows us to pinpoint
the considerations needed in order to compose web3-friendly regulation. From the governments perspective, web3-friendly regulation is
to clearly and distinctly outline what is taxable and what is criminal. From the consumers perspective, it means regulation that protects consumers
from criminals and their governments while not inhibiting technological advancements, social advancements, and global consumerism.

#### Row by row application

Now within each row we apply the below in order to understand the concerns from a broad perspective.

```
a) Government Concerns
    example a
    example b
    example c

b) Consumer Risks
    example a
    example b
    example c

c) Cons to over-regulation
    example a
    example b
    example c

d) Cons to lack of regulation
    example a
    example b
    example c

e) Does technology exist that meets all of the consumer and government risks?

    If so, what is it and what considerations above is it fulfilling?

```

<Callout>Why does my wallet require regulation?</Callout>

There is no bank in crypto, you control your keys and you control your assets which means you are own bank. However, you
didn't build that bank and you design the cryptography that creates your private keys, so it comes
with risk that may or may not have been integrated if you had built your bank yourself.

In the United States the government insures your assets in the bank up to $250,000 in case the bank fails
and your money is gone. That means if you have more than $250,000 in that one bank, then you lose out on the difference too.

The reason the government can insure your assets is because the government has laws in place that govern this process in addition
to wanting to provide a financial backstop at the business-level in case a particular bank fails and customers lose
their money because of a risk outside of their control. Separately, there is a chance of a systemic risk that could affect
multiple banks for the same reason that may or may be outside of the banks control, so this provides greater financial security.

Most banks dont hold all of the funds that their customers deposit into it, but the blockchain does. You access your
assets on the blockchain through a wallet but the wallet doesnt hold your assets, its only an access point to your assets.
In fact, when you create a wallet, you are creating a private key and a seed phrase, when you create a wallet using one particular brand,
you can take your private key and / or seed phrase and input that in another wallet brand and have access to your assets?
That doesnt happen in the physical world, so this means its a completely new area that will be included in the context of
regulating wallets on the blockchain.

Cryptography doesnt need to be regulated but it needs to be understood so that the applicable laws are in place and that
they are updated accordingly and in real-time. 0-day vulnerabilities exist and even though the laws dont need to update in one
day, they do need to be updated to the new education and mitigation techniques learned from 0-day vulnerabilities.

What makes up the function of a wallet and what functions are able to even regulated and why?

Even though each wallet is created differently, there are several types of wallet to consider beforehand. There are
wallets that require a single-signer and those that require multiple signers known as Multi-Party Computation (MPC) wallets,
not to be confused with multi-signature (multi-sig) wallets, like those created by Gnosis Safe. The difference between
MPC and multi-sig wallets is at the transaction level and not necessarily the cryptographic level, so they will be
addressed separately.

There are internet-connected wallets called hot wallets of which there are two examples, browser-based wallets and app-based wallets.
Then there are cold wallets which are not connected to the internet but can either be connected through an app or never have
the ability to be connected. Cold wallets like Ledger are able to connect to the ineternet through an app which imposes different
and distinct vulnerabilities that cold wallets that do not have the ability to connect to the internet like hardware security modules,
HSM's.

When you create a wallet the blockchain is creating a private key and then your wallet interprets the seed phrase from that
and displays both for you. Both of these items are presented to you in different fashions and both of them are saved for you
in different fashions as well, both permanently and temporarily. These are the items that require regulatory insight into
protecting consumers and their assets.

<Callout>How Private Keys and Seed Phrases Influence Regulatory Focus</Callout>

When creating a wallet, the blockchain generates a private key, and the wallet then interprets and displays a corresponding seed phrase.
Both the private key and seed phrase are critical to asset security. Their generation, storage, and presentation to the user require
careful regulatory attention, including guidelines for:

- Secure Key Generation Methods: Ensuring that the cryptographic libraries and random number generators used are audited, certified,
  and free from known vulnerabilities.
- Seed Phrase Display Practices: Requiring that the seed phrase never be transmitted unencrypted over the internet,
  that users are warned to back it up securely offline, and that wallet providers disclose how seed phrases are handled internally.
- Temporary vs. Permanent Storage: Establishing rules around where and how the private key and seed phrase can be cached,
  stored, or backed up—especially if they are ever retained on the provider’s infrastructure.

<Callout>A principle-based approach to wallet regulation</Callout>

Key Principles Might Include:

- Security by Design:
  Regulators would require that wallets be developed following industry best practices for encryption, key generation,
  and access controls. Similar to existing cybersecurity standards (e.g., ISO 27001), wallet developers would need to prove they
  follow secure development lifecycles and conduct routine external audits.

- Transparency and Disclosure:
  Wallet providers should clearly explain their security features, risks, and responsibilities to users. For instance,
  disclosing whether a wallet supports hardware-based key storage, what cryptographic libraries it uses, and how frequently
  it undergoes penetration testing.

- User Education and Support:
  Mandating clear, accessible guidance for end-users on how to secure their seed phrases and private keys.
  This could mirror the financial advice disclosures required of traditional financial institutions. Additionally,
  support channels should be available to help users respond to breaches or key-compromise events.

- Adaptability and Continual Improvement:
  Regulators and industry participants collaborate to update guidelines as new threats emerge. This iterative approach is
  inspired by the way safety standards evolve in industries like aviation or automotive manufacturing.
  As zero-day vulnerabilities arise, the regulation encourages rapid patching, transparent communication,
  and proactive standards updates.

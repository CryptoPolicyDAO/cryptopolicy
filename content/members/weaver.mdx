  Michael saw the need for regulatory clarity while he was
  starting a Web3 insurance company called called inDemniFi. In order to write 
  the policies and design the financials, there needed to be an existing regulatory or
  financial framework to work with. When there was nothing to use, he became motivated to work
  on it himself. So, he founded Crypto Policy DAO in order collaborate with others
  to draft and help implement web3-friendly regulation.

Michael was bit by the crypto bug in early 2020 and hasnt turned back since. Even though his own brother
was mining bitcoin in 2011, its hard to believe he waited to dive in to crypto in 2020.
